this attack uses a packet crafter, like Ettercap, to broadcast unsolicited ARP packets

ARP poisoning attack


This attack is used to target a switch which will overwhelm it with requests.

Mac flooding (this will flood the mac address table which is used to determine which port to use to forward unicast traffic to its correct destination. this will cause the switch to stop applying mac-based forwarding and flood unicast traffic out on all ports. Making it a hub)
